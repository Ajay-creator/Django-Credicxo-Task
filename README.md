# Django-Credicxo-Task

### My Implementation
- Using CLI we can create super user and the super user from the admin portal can add users and assign roles according to their group either Teacher or Student.
- In the API, only Teachers and Admin can add students and list them.
- Student can login and just see his details and then logout.
- JWT authentication has been used.
### Available end points are:
- `localhost/api/register/` to add students
- `localhost/api/login/` to Login
- `localhost/api/logout/` to Logout
- `localhost/api/user/` to show user details
- `localhost/api/listStudents/` to list Students
